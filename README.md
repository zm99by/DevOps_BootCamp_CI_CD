## Day 2 Jenkins Fundamentals

```
In this course, we will cover the fundamentals of Jenkins, including continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) and continuous deployment. After that, we will move on to installing and configuring Jenkins, and get familiar with the graphical user interface. We will explore jobs and builds as well as build agents. This will give us the foundation we need to accomplish more complex Jenkins tasks.

## Day 3 Jenkins by Doing

```
You learn faster and better when you learn by doing. With that in mind, this course has been designed to allow you to practice core Jenkins Builds through a 100% hands-on experience. To accomplish this, Linux Academy's Training Architects have hand-selected a set of the best Jenkins hands-on labs we have to offer.

Everything in this course will be on one or more Linux servers provisioned with whatever needed through our hands-on lab and Cloud Playground platform.

There's no reason to wait; learn by doing today!
